# ArdentChat
ArdentChat is a web application for people to have individual communication with each other. It was originally one of my assignments from my internship at Ardent Academy. It is also my first full-stack project that uses the MERN stack.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Running the Application

### Built With
- React.js
  - Material-UI
  - UUID
- MongoDB Atlas
  - Mongoose
- Node.js
  - nodemon
- Express.js
  - CORS
- Socket.IO

## Versioning
I used only Git bash for version management.

## Acknowledgments
I want to say thank you to my fellow interns in Ardent Academy for their assistance. Also, kudos to Dr. Li for providing this amazing opportunity to let me work in Ardent.
